I am in st Marys secondary school library. Its silent, the air is clean, you are sitting in a table just on the left of the main entrance.
Its peaceful as you are perusing around some old white magazines on physics real life applications.
You admire the pictures of beautiful families going about their day. Its more of an 60 to 80s setting. 
Ooh, what a nice dejavu.
You await to hear the bell so that you go straight to the dormitories.
Along the way you notice the empty basket ball field on your left and the empty main hall ahead of you. You can smell the aroma of fried onions from the teachers quarters which reminds you of home.
You remember your mom back at home and all you can visualize is her cooking supper while a television is playing in the sitting room. The peacefulness, the calmness, the never lacking environment, a place where you are well taken care of, a place where you can eat when you feel like, a place where you get to taste all sorts of foods, a place you sleep the most peaceful, a place that feels more like heaven than a dream. I dread to go home.

The term is almost halfway and we are nearing the Assessment period, I have to study, but its during this period where I experience the undeniable urge to fantasize. Fantasies feel more real, clear,sweet,the feelings a raw, unadulterated, simple.

It’s a whole different feeling when you know of a heaven you can get to.

You are now in heaven, be content and don’t dwell on the lack of anything, coz the heaven you were longing for is already here and complete just as you thought.
